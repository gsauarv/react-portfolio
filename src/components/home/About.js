                Who am I is an eternal question that we are all trying to answer
                day by day. Personally, I am a student who is constantly
                learning from my mistakes, success, and any activity that I
                engage in in my life. I describe myself as a technology
                enthusiast because I often use technology to solve real life
                problems.
